Mint is moving to Credit Karma. I am moving to Lunch Money.

Specific use cases with high demand:
Amazon receipt matcher

Do you make a lot of Amazon purchases? I'm sure by now you know how frustrating it is to try to identify exactly what the expense is for! Build an Amazon receipt matcher that pulls in your Amazon purchase history and matches on transactions in Lunch Money and updates the notes.
